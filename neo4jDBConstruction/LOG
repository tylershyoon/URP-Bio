Tested Round 1 & Round 2
    Round 1: retrieved data from hg38 public db, solely from knownGene
    Round 2: retrieved data from knownGene natural join kgXref
    R1 & R2 both yielded 246 tuples
    -> No data loss when join two table
    -> Add Round 2 two more attributes from kgXref(geneSymbol, refseq)
    to be stored
    Until now we have 246 tuples - retrieved from ucsc IDs
    => knownGene.name & kgXref.kgID

To check how many genes are processed with Round 2,
made R2 return the list of ucsc genes, count the number of elements in set.
=> exactly 246, no duplicates

Among 246 genes,
['uc003bzm.1', 'uc001jts.1', 'uc002fmz.1', 'uc003hbs.1', 'uc002qqs.1', 'uc001ukz.1', 'uc001kqq.1', 'uc001pkb.1', 'uc002qnz.1', 'uc002olz.1', 'uc002anc.1', 'uc001ccf.1']
12 genes above are only non changed genes.
all other 234 genes has upper version-ed ucsc gene id.


Possible Round 3
-> Tested with unknown Genes
there were many with refseq that start with NM_~
those are searchable in knownGene as well as kgXref
but their ucsc gene ID were different from the one in excel file.

But tried to retrieve them since their name and refseq were same.

-> 45(1)/87 retrieved
NM_032160 -> two tuple obtained
42 remained unknown

Round 4-2
used all_mrna table.
26 distinct genes were found

=> 16 genes are left unknown.

Will create class for Rounds, upload to neo4j database.
